# BLE-mesh SIM

This is a simulation of a BLE-mesh network. It uses the [vis-network](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/) library to visualize the network.

Currently this is not an accurate simulation of my BLE-mesh project. The goal is to finalize this simulation so that I can use it to test things like connection heuristics and ensure that network formation is optimal. I might also use this to test building routing algorithms to see how they perform under different network topologies.

You should be able to run this simulation by opening the `index.html` file in your browser, there's no fancy stack or anything, just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
